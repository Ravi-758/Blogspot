Should we strive to be good‚Äîand if so, why? If you asked twenty people what it means to be a good person, chances are you would get twenty different answers. What individuals perceive to be good character traits can vary depending on several factors. Religion, culture, and family dynamics, for example, can all play a part in forming ones viewpoint on a topic like this.</p><p>Note that human beings are complex and that sorting all people into the strict binary of ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù is generally not possible or particularly helpful. Attempting to do so can even result in <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-to-recognize-and-tame-your-cognitive-distortions-202205042738\"><strong><u>distorted thinking</u></strong></a>, which can sometimes lead to mental health concerns like low self-esteem, anxiety, or depression. Here, well use being a ‚Äúgood‚Äù person as a general term that refers to behaving in ways that are broadly considered to be considerate and kind, but it can be helpful to keep in mind the deep nuances of a topic like morality.</p><figure class=\"image\" style=\"height:auto;\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:917/611;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/r2Gf0m7pccLbqaOeDUxw4xchqK5xksI3LVufCk8yLdbezMjZwk9GGHOEkrxEWcnBxe-39mnz9IxkCJlqW1fSXrNIO3d3ROS3rc7fY-NOxTXXA0a1PQTTfF8WPLEEtJaDDgvxG0PIcoY8nYe4PYAQ7A\" alt=\"Article Visual\" width=\"917\" height=\"611\"></figure><p>Being a good person does matter</p><p><a href=\"https://www.betterhelp.com/get-started/\">Work with a trained online therapist</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What is goodness?</h2><p>The word \"good\" is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/good\"><strong><u>defined by Merriam-Webster</u></strong></a>&nbsp;as \"virtuous, right and commendable; kind and benevolent.\"&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thoreau/\"><strong><u>Henry David Thoreau</u></strong></a>&nbsp;was quoted as saying, \"Goodness is the only investment that never fails.\"</p><p>Ultimately, though, ‚Äúgood‚Äù is a subjective term‚Äîbut in general, it can very broadly be defined as a person who acts in ways that are perceived to be morally positive or upstanding.</p><p>A ‚Äúgood‚Äù person often has certain habits or characteristics that reflect their efforts to be a considerate individual who avoids harming others. While, again, these can vary from person to person and culture to culture, a few general examples of these traits can include the following.</p><h3>Empathy</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://www.betterhelp.com/advice/general/understanding-empathy-definition-psychology-practice-and-application/\"><strong><u>empathy definition in psychology</u></strong></a> is the ability to emotionally understand another persons feelings by imagining yourself in their position. An&nbsp;empathetic person&nbsp;tends to be able to express an understanding of how others feel and treat them accordingly.</p><h3>Honesty</h3><p>An individual who wants to be a good person might also strive to be honest with themselves and others. Dishonesty can damage trust between two people and potentially lead to distance or conflict within a relationship.</p><h3>Fairness</h3><p>Someone who practices the principle of fairness might aim to be aware of their biases and avoid letting those negatively affect others. This could manifest as a belief in justice or equality, for example.&nbsp;</p><h3>Responsibility</h3><p>Responsibility or accountability for ones actions is also considered by many to be a sign of a good person. It usually involves an effort to make decisions that arent harmful to others and to take ownership of them if they are.</p><h2>Why being a good person matters</h2><p>Ones motivation for being ‚Äúgood‚Äù can vary widely. Research suggests that altruism‚Äîor the act of showing selfless concern for the well-being of others‚Äî<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-020-02890-y\"><strong><u>is a uniquely human trait</u></strong></a>, of which there are many examples. Biologically, evolutionarily, or on some other level, many may feel generally driven to be kind and not harmful‚Äîa trait that many people equate with being a good person.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there are many other complex factors that go into how humans decide to behave, and our actions can have effects on many areas of our lives. If youre in the process of deciding what values you want to live by, you might consider some of these potential outcomes of who you may choose to be.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\" style=\"height:auto;\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:903/602;\" src=\"https://dy7glz37jgl0b.cloudfront.net/advice/images/39732cb0715c2a3b547785ccb83407e1-man-smiles-at-computer-hands-clasped_l.jpeg\" alt=\"A man wearing a denim button-down shirt smiles widely and grasps his hands together as he attends an online therapy session from his home office. \" width=\"903\" height=\"602\"><figcaption>Getty/10000 Hours</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Effects on your career and opportunities</h3><p>Your actions and behaviors help&nbsp;build your reputation which, among many other factors, can help to create the opportunities you encounter in life. Behaving in ways that are generally respectful of others may help others develop a positive opinion of you. This could lead to benefits in your career and other opportunities that may help you achieve what youre looking for in life.</p><h3>Effects on relationships</h3><p>The way we behave can also impact how others see us and relate to us, which can affect our relationships overall. For instance, many people are looking for friends and romantic partners who are ‚Äúgood‚Äù people in that theyre honest, caring, respectful, etc. People who are looking for healthy, supportive relationships often tend to seek out others who make them feel safe rather than uneasy or disrespected.</p><h3>Feeling a sense of purpose</h3><p>Deciding on a set of values that you want to live by and then sticking to them as best you can may help give you a direction and a purpose in life. This <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35483500/\"><strong><u>may even correlate with less loneliness</u></strong></a> and better overall health.</p><h2>Seeking support related to being a good person</h2><p>The idea of being a ‚Äúgood‚Äù person can affect a persons mental health in a variety of ways. For instance, a person might have trouble coping with mistakes theyve made in the past and how they may have affected those around them. Or, they could hold themselves to an impossible standard of perfection, which could lead to feelings of depression or anxiety. If youre looking for support in discovering your values or changing the way you relate to morality, a therapist may be able to help.</p><figure class=\"image\" style=\"height:auto;\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:918/612;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FUBA7i7LHk8SR0-6j-bkA-S2nuedF8T_tgnz1NHB-_r92HlnmssiH-58MpbeXescv9vFdZDYNXMZcIAsVNe245B5_JFR-24g6hTxXZLYmfj2luX7o4ROyycAxBweIIYXPp9NiF3LDNdacHoqmQ1s_w\" alt=\"Article Visual\" width=\"918\" height=\"612\"></figure>',	'2024-04-06 06:40:03',	NULL,	NULL,	'ashley-batz-betmVWGYcLY-unsplash.jpg'),

Eating probiotic-rich foods like yogurt, kefir and fermented vegetables can further boost gut health.</span></p><h2>5. Promotes Longevity</h2><p><span style=\"color:rgb(19,52,59);\">Eating a nutritious diet is one of the most important lifestyle factors for living a long, healthy life. Studies show that people who eat more fruits, vegetables and whole grains have a lower risk of dying from any cause. Healthy eating habits can add years to your life and life to your years.In conclusion, eating a diet based on whole, minimally processed foods is one of the best things you can do for your health. Prioritize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats and probiotic-rich foods. Limit added sugars, sodium, unhealthy fats and processed items. With a little planning, eating healthy can be delicious and satisfying. Your body and mind will thank you for fueling them with nutritious foods.</span></p>',	'2024-05-17 05:03:25',	NULL,	NULL,	'IMG_3339.jpeg'),
